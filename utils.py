A beacon of wisdom, his presence shows.
From ZÃ¼rich's peaks to England's plains,
He charts the course where learning reigns.

With circuits, codes, and signals bright,
He deciphers truths, brings them to light.
In lectures filled with passion's fire,
He lifts young minds, inspires higher.

Through channels where data streams align,
He weaves the threads, designs the sign.
A mentor, guide, and scholar true,
In every task, excellence he pursues.

Awards may grace his learned name,
Yet humble hearts define his fame.
In every student's grateful voice,
Echoes the impact of his choice.

So here's to Sayir, whose endless quest,
Ignites the minds, inspires the best.
A luminary in academia's sphere,
His legacy shines, year after year.
