Meeting 1 19/05/25:

Channel estimation
    Want to find channel length by estimation in the time domain in order to use frequency method
    This will be put into the spec

Synchronisation
    Chirp
    Research other methods
    Adjusting for drift without resending the white noise/ chirp mid signal

Coding
    Reed soloman code stacked with the LDPC code to get very good header error rates

Standard name

First Report
    Due Wednesday 4pm
    Technical writing focus
    Write about one of the methods - plans and implementations



Notes for future discussion:

H[0] filter coefficient
    If you have 0 as the first data bit for the pilot tone then you have 0/0 for the coefficient estimation
    Therefore don't know H[0] - is this a problem if the OFDM symbol (block) always starts with zero?
    Could this unkown coefficient be large and amplify some noise?
